# Docker Compose

- The docker-compose up command is used to start the services defined in a Docker Compose configuration file. 
- Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. 
- It allows you to define a multi-container application in a single file (docker-compose.yml) and manage the lifecycle of the application's services as a single unit.
- Docker Compose makes it easier to manage complex, multi-container applications, such as microservices architectures, by enabling you to start all the containers with a single command.
